# Hovedprosjekt

I chose to make a website for a imaginative cocktail-bar as my main project. 
The website consists of four pages - "Home", "Our menu", "Book table" and "About us". 
I have used html, css and javascript to build the website. I have tried to use as much as I could of the skills 
we have acquired over the past semester, including flexbox, forms, slideshow, css animation, javascript filter 
function etc. 

All of the pages apart from the "Book table" page has a two-column layout made with flexbox. 
On the "Home" page I made an infinite image slideshow with @keyframes animation.
On the "Our menu" page I made a menu, and used javascript to be able to filter between cocktails, wine
and snacks. 
On the "Book table" page I made a form with html and css where the visitor can book a table in the bar, 
by choosing date, time, number of guests etc. I used javascript to incrorpotate popup messages in case not all 
of the fields are filled out, and a confirmation popup when the booking is complete.
